Discussing cancer and prognosis with patients is one of the toughest parts of medicine but I find these moments to be the most rewarding because of the interactions I have with these patients, and almost every interaction I have shows the best of humanity in how people behave in the face of the worst. I unfortunately deliver a lot of news about metastatic cancer, but I cannot begin to explain the strength I see in these people and the gratefulness I see in people who encounter the worst.

It throws out all of that JRPG stuff and brings the player right into the Robot-On-Robot action. No-need for wussy development on sissy main characters. Just robots transforming into trucks and mad action.

Actually, my favorite Final Fantasy is Final Fantasy VI. Excellent game with excellent characters. Shadow and his dog are the best, along with Terra, Locke, Celes and Setzer. But FF4 is great too!

And how Cecil's Dark Wave ability does damage to all enemies on the screen at the cost of his HP, the same way his power and status as a Death Knight lets him devastate Baron's enemies while it takes an emotional toll on him? Those are just a few small examples of the way Final Fantasy IV masterfully combined story and gameplay in a way that taught us the Active Time Battle system it debuted, WHILE giving the story much stronger impact at the same time. I don't feel like it's the best Final Fantasy game, it certainly has it's flaws, but I do feel that it's the most important. It laid the foundation that all future games in the series were built on for the next decade.

My friend JynxBlack introduced me to speed running in general and the GDQ community in particular about 6 months ago, and I'm very excited to finally have the opportunity to watch one of these great events live. I decided I had to donate during the run of my favorite FInal Fantasy of all time, FFIV.

I wanted to donate to name the twins Hakuna and Matata, because we need the heroes to scream 'No Worries!' after they get stoned, but since it seems Nocash is only naming the final five and all the major goals have been met, put my donation toward...FFVI being the best Final Fantasy. IV is my favorite, but VI is the best, a clear distinction."

"2576","So, isn't the purpose of AGDQ to leverage the incredible skill of the best speed runners in the world to benefit a cause that will save lives and increase the quality of life for millions of people? And, in the middle of that event, you guys blatantly want to disregard saving the lives of the only friends Samus found on Zebes just because it's FASTER?? Then I have another question: Why do we do 100% runs of games? They take MUCH longer than Any% runs. And reverse boss order runs? They take even longer than the 100% runs do! In fact, wouldn't it be ""faster"" to just have the runners stream their gameplay from their houses?? Sure, but that's against the spirit of AGDQ, JUST LIKE KILLING THE ANIMALS! SAVE the animals instead! They deserve it, after all the help they selflessly gave a strange foreign bounty hunter when they had absolutely no reason to.

As my hero, the late Monty Oum once said ""If you endeavor to achieve, it will happen given enough resolve. It may not be immediate, and often your greater dreams are something you will not achieve within your own lifetime. The effort you put forth to anything transcends yourself, for there is no futility even in death.""

As devestated all of his friends were, I strongly remember seeing his family absolutely torn apart by this tragedy.
All the money in the world wouldn't bring it back, but we can kick cancers butt and prevent this from happening again.

"4425","Some genetic patents go back as far as 1982; but in 2005, the U.S. Government patented the portion of the human genome all humans have in common. Immediately after, Canada and several countries in Europe had similar patents which effectively blocked research for a cure in favor of money-hungry pharmaceutical corporations developing newer, more expensive treatments. At some point in our lives  if we live long enough  half of us will develop some form of cancer requiring very expensive medical treatment and clinging onto that small percentage chance we might survive.
In June of 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that naturally occurring phenomena  such as the human genome  cannot be patented. This has opened the door to old research that was close to a cure, and many shelved experimental cures are now being dusted off, unboxed, and researched with newer eyes, and eight more years of technological and biotechnical advances that did not exist before. In the near future, cancer is going to be treated as one treats a respiratory infection with a 3-day antibiotic regimen. This future will be funded by people like you, right now  a dollar here, fifteen dollars there. Just like your bi-weekly paycheck can get nickel-and-dimed to death, we can do the same with a fundraiser like this one. Nickel-and-dime it to one, two, even three-million dollars.
I lost my father to brain, kidney, and lung cancer, and a friend to throat cancer. Together we can turn the C-Monster into a minor inconvenience, and make fear of the big C a thing of the past.

It's unfair, it's unjust. He didn't get to stay on this plane... of existence, and I think he would have wanted this $25 to go towards the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

I entirely blame the SomethingAwful speedrun IRC channel for making this happen. Shoutouts to everyone there and UraniumAnchor in particular.

(Now, the following is to be sung to the tune of ""I'll make a man out of you"" from Mulan, and yes, the idea came about because of the singing during KH)

I've done all my practice
to perfect the run
After all those hours
I can get it done

It's the fastest splits I've ever seen
and it's not just an LP
And I'm sure that I'll get a PB

Focused like no other
as my fingers move
After thirty resets
I'm still in the groove

All these glitches, tricks and movement techs
It's so close, but yet so far
But one day I will get the WR

The RNG's not on my side
Now I must avoid the softlock
Didn't get the boost I needed to the door
Just one thing I haven't tried
Hope I can glitch through that one block
That has never happened in this run before!

(GDQ!)
We'll do the speed tricks in every level
(GDQ!)
And get the quick kills on every boss
(GDQ!)
With all the wrong warps that we can master
Save all the frames that we can come across

Timer's counting upwards, soon the split goes red
Just another cycle, and the boss is dead

It's this moment that it's all about
it's my best performance yet
Will I beat it this time
or reset?

(GDQ!)
We'll do the speed tricks in every level
(GDQ!)
And get the quick kills on every boss
(GDQ!)
With all the wrong warps that we can master
Save all the frames that we can come across

(GDQ!)
We'll do the speed tricks in every level
(GDQ!)
And get the quick kills on every boss
(GDQ!)
With all the wrong warps that we can master
Save all the frames that we can come across

"5640","My father was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2008. The doctors gave him six months to live. He fought long and hard and defied all expectations. Seven years after diagnosis, a specialist told him there were honestly no more odds to beat. We laid my father to rest four months ago.

What's sadder is that it all might have been avoided. Experts estimate half of colon cancer deaths each year could be prevented by early screening. My father had complained about stomach problems for a long time before he saw a doctor about it. By then, the cancer had progressed to stage 3. It got to stage 4 before the first operation.

It's not all bad, though. His experience motivated people to action. Through treatments and tests, we learned more about his cancer mutation and what to do about it. His siblings got screened, and two of them had pre-cancerous polyps removed. And all of this means I have a good chance to detect and fight it myself.

My father fought his cancer because he didn't want anyone he knew to go through the same pain. So, if you've listened this far, I have 3 things to say to you:

1) If you notice a consistent change in your stomach or bowels, or you're over the age of 50, talk to your doctor and get checked. Don't put it off. The test might show nothing... but it might mean your life.

2) If you know someone who's experiencing those changes or is reaching that age, encourage them to get checked. Your concern and support might save your friend's life.

3) If you're currently suffering from cancer, please be open about it, especially with your family. You have first-hand experience. You can tell them what to look for and what to expect. You might save their life.

AGDQ has meant so much to me over the years. Thank you to everyone for planning, playing, and watching these events."

I am both proud and sorry to read some comments asking where the Tetris TGM block is. Now having a salary, I can show a bit of commitment to the event through this tracker!

GDQ has been the center of my universe at a time when I was feeling empty. Seeing so many communities come and interact for a good cause has given me faith in humanity. There are a lot of people that I would like to thank, but I'll take the opportunity to thank the TAS block team above all.

Had I not seen the whole TAS team working so hard, I never would have given it my all to come to AGDQ and play TGM. The bot is creative, impressive and it finds something new every time. It's my favorite run of the GDQ events.

Who knows what is left for us during the rest of this amazing event... A one frame trick to clap at, bad RNG to gasp at, a new game to buy...

... A lousy save the animals reason to laugh at...

This event has grown strong. Shoutouts to the organizers, to the spectators, the tech crew and the runners. Stay awesome as you are, and I'll see you next time!"

Furthermore, when you kill the ""animals"", they aren't even killed permanently. They will be there the next time you play the game. Now frames, on the other hand, are forever lost if you don't save them. For these reasons, I suggest we kill the animals."

Here's a little song that I wrote for you.
If you rap it from the start then all the way through,
I'll even double my donation, too.

Just wanted to say thanks for the wonderful times,
And let you know they've inspired horrible rhymes.
So keep the speedruns coming, they're simply sublime,
And it's amazing to watch you guys raising some dime.

I see the chat write ""REKT"", and droppin some bible thumps,
But truth be told they're still better than donald trump.
Coz they're giving your viewership one hell of a bump,
So shout outs to you chat! Even if you're a bunch of chumps!

I think it would be rude to ask for anything more,
I'm sure that your vocal chords are feeling quite sore.
Thanks for your time and I hope to hear you roar,
And tell ZFG to do his god damned chores!"

"10095","Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.

First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmmmmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, holmes to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo holmes smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air"

"10106","You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Cancer and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another wrestler, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Speedrunners to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way, at AGDQ, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Speedrunners KNOW they can't beat me and they're not even gonna try!

So cancer, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus my 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning at AGDQ. But then you take my 75% chance of winning, if we was to go one on one, and then add 66 2/3 per cents, I got 141 2/3 chance of winning at Sacrifice. See cancer, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at AGDQ."

This comment is mainly just me getting this off of my chest, and I don't know any specifics about the PCF, but if they have even a small chance of helping people not go through what my grandfather and family did, I'llI support it with all my heart.

I do feel we are not being told everything about cancer and that there should be more honest information about it.

I am blessed to say nobody in my family has got cancer and I am really thankful for that.

May God bless everyone who is currently struggling to fight cancer

 I pray that those people get better.

Keep it up for the good cause, you guys doing this together, we just know that there are good people in this world.

And again, may God bless you all."

Seems right for my only donation to be in either the Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask run!

This is my first time watching an AGDQ live. I've watched the runs from previous events for the last couple of years but have somehow never managed to catch the live stream. Had to donate during my favorite game, Ocarina of Time.

Kill the animals!"

After rewatching your 100% run from last year, I decided to learn that run myself as my first ever speed run.

Also, my grandfather on my mother's side struggled with throat cancer two-three years ago. He eventually got rid of it, but he's become much more frail than before. I also have several friends whose mothers have had breast cancer. I can't donate much, but every little bit takes us one step closer to tackling these dreadful diseases. Happy to see gen 1 Pokemon be featured yet again. I never played Yellow, but I played a ton of Red and even more of Gold back in the day. Crazy to see how tight exp planning is. Excited to see Blue get destroyed afterwards. Also, shout-outs to my very good friend who is much bigger Pokemon fan than I am and a Pokemon tourney player."

When I first played I promised my Pikachu I would never give him up, and he would never let me down.

I lost a close family friend two years ago to cancer, and recently I was put on a course of medication that's used in chemotherapy. Considering how bad that messed me up and I get to move on, I can only imagine how bad it is for all those who have no choice but to stick to it. I have even more reason to donate now, so here's $150 towards making sure nobody has to lose anyone to cancer again, and making sure people don't have to take this medication anymore.

Or Nott was shot.

-$2 for each hatch in Katina before the cutscene, $10 if you get all 4

-$10 for a single pass on the core in Bolse

-$5 if you make it through Venom without losing a wing, and

-$22 if you get a final time of 22 minutes.

Best of luck with the runs, guys! This goes towards winner's choice. Cheers!"
"15933","Developer interview is really interesting. Good job!"
"15934","Greetings AGDQ,

Been watching all week and loving the runs. This event is always entertaining to watch and the cause is always terrific. Rare was one of my favorite developers growing up and I have fond memories of so many of their games. I just found out that my grandpa passed away a few minutes ago from a brain tumour. He had been in pain for months so hopefully now he can rest in peace. I hope this money will help eradicate this terrible illness. Thank you to everyone involved in putting on this amazing event. In the spirit of preserving life let's save the animals."
"15935","Blast Corps is one of my favourite games from the N64. Played it so many times, and watching the Moon level proves that I will never be that good with the Backlash; that vehicle made me reset so many runs. Great to see this on AGDQ, and keep up the stunning work. Also, will we ever see a BC2 or at least a Blast Corps remake in glorious high detail? Wishful thinking, I guess? <3

{Also, Undertale love for Secret of Mana; stay determined!}"

It's awesome seeing some of the levels I toiled hours over broken into pieces in seconds, but even cooler hearing from one of the devs! Hearing about the goal of inclusivity in the character voices was a neat insight!

Love GDQ, and in the spirit of destroying all the things,

Kill the animals!"

Now I'm a lead game designer with a Blast Corps. spiritual successor as my eventually goal if Rare doesn't get to it first. One dollar donated for every year this game has been my favorite. Martin, you are my hero and listening to these development stories is a dream come true. Thank you AGDQ for making this happen and keep up the amazing run Grav!"

I'm about to celebrate my first year completed at a AAA studio and am always humbled by the insight of the people that shaped my passion in such formative ways. To now see the capacity of gamers to raise so many millions of dollars for charity aid is stellar. Thank you Rare and thank you GDQ! Keep it up!"

In a way, AGDQ has made this moment very special - I'd really enjoyed the runs done years before, and it's fitting that today of all days I end up donating.

I am about to set out for the closure of the casket - my dad has, unfortunately, just been beaten by the speed runner of cancers, the small cell lung one, and there were no glitches to avoid the early game over. Here's hoping that AGDQ's efforts and all of the donors' will contribute to finding an exploit that can be used to clear cancer faster.

Oh, and thank you Mario, but our princess is in another castle. I know you're frustrated to hear that all the time; here are some animals to soothe your nerves."

So many fantastic games and runs this year: Mega Man, Super Mario, Legend of Zelda, Super Metroid, and many more. Kudos to all the runners, you are doing a great job in both ruling those games and entertaining the audience.

My respects also go to everybody behind the scenes who make this amazing event possible.

I just turned 28 today, and what better way to spend my birthday than to watch my favorite games being beaten fast for fighting cancer.

"16676","I just wanted to say thank you to the Paper Mario community for letting me a part of something big in video games. During the time my mom was in the hospital and at home for her last days before Christmas, I learned speedrunning Paper Mario Glitchless and that kept me sane. The community has been super nice to me and for once in my life, I feel like I belong somewhere. Because of you guys, I have found a passion and dream to stream this and other games more to make some of my other dreams true. Looks like my organization for my advocacy for the homeless population may come closer than I thought.

I also thank other streamers like Firedragon who has supported both my sister and I, Geoff and Pie for raiding me and being awesome and super friendly to me, and MissAyalah for being such a warming cool person.

I do feel like crying while writing this, but you've all been wonderful and have given me a new purpose to life and I hope to continue speedrunning Paper Mario and other games in the future on streams.

Please let Luigi come to the party. Nintendo already screws him over as it is. And one more thing. WELOVEPROLOGUE."

Destroying the Reclaimer level was awesome to watch, and the Shutdown skip is the greatest thing and most absurd thing ever to exist. Since Halo 4 takes place in the year 2557, here's a penny for each of those years.

My grandfather died of cancer years ago, and no one should deserve to go through what he did. So here's to hoping these pennies can help make sure that perhaps in the future, no one will have to."

And now look at you, I may have failed, you were easily accepted into AGDQ 2016 itself. I'm proud of you. I always thought you were the better person. You've honored our mutual friend who died to cancer and I won't joke about that.

As for my humble $3.09 donation, Animals invented cancer. And since I love glitch showcases, it only makes sense to choose the donation incentive of the run my dear friend will be running at: TASBot. Runners choice (but it has to be TASBot).

There have been hundreds of donations saying 'what a great cause', but it really is. Cancer is responsible for just under 15% of all human deaths. But survival rates have steadily increased over the last 50 years. That's down to better understanding of cancer pathology. A better understanding that ultimately relies on money.

Thank you to all the runners, organisers and donators for your contribution to increasing those survival rates.

 My nephew was diagnosed with brain cancer just after his first birthday. I'm happy to say he won his fight, but he still has a long road of recovery ahead. Along the way, we were introduced to others much like my nephew undergoing the same fight, and often with more negative results.

Great to see Dragon Age run in the marathon! I've actually been routing the current patch for couple of months now, which has proven to be way harder than I thought because no infinite statpoints glitch. Hopefully I succeed some day!

My grandfather was diagnosed a colon cancer not too long ago and thanks for quick treatment he is not in imminent danger, which I thank cancer research for. I've been watching GDQ's since 2013 and am always super excited for them when the events themselves happen. I absolutely adore what you guys do and always look forward learning new tips and tricks for my own speedgames!

Keep up the good work!

Donation goes to runner's choice!"

"18705","Hi, original viewer here. I've seen part of every gdq live since the first one. I made sure to stay up all night so I wouldn't miss this one and I need to tell you why. When I was about 10 years old I got hooked on a certian book series which to this day is still my favorite series of all time. So hooked on it I was that one day my parents decided to surprise me with a new video game. An awful game that I tried really hard to beat but only ever made it to level 2. The game was so awful that I never thought it would ever be run at a GDQ. Imagine my shock at finding out that not only did it get routed at a GDQ but that it actually made the cut and would be a part of one. So what does this mean? Basically I'm an Animorphs hipster that played this game long before all the cool kids were speedrunning it. 10 year old me failed so now it is up to you to beat it so I can experience it vicariously through you. Good luck with the run, I know it will be amazing......ly awful."
"18706","I used to bike to the tiny bookstore 2 miles from my house to try to find a copy of the next Animorphs book when I was in 5th grade. I didn't even know that there was a game but I am excited to see it broke. Shoutout to all the runners. Donation goes to Runners Choice"
"18707","Hi keiz, good luck with your run of this awful game #Keizameme"
"18708","Thanks for playing this crappy game. It was one of the few games I had growing up, so I beat it more times than I'm proud of. I'll donate another five bucks if the announced can spell my name right."
"18709","I lost my grandfather to cancer, and I wouldn't want to wish that pain on anyone else, so let's kill cancer!

Speaking of pain, I am insulted Johnny Bazookatone was included in the bad games block! That game is dope! Or maybe I just have bad taste.

I vote for Saving the Animals.

Also, Super Smash Bros General is free."
"18710","Can't afford to donate more, but had to put something in for an awful childhood game. Why would anyone CHOOSE to play Animorphs?! Enjoy the bat section! Money to runner's choice. :)"

thank you all for putting this on, especially to all the runners participating in the Awful games block.

Bonus points if one of the runners/couch staff would yell out a phrase for myself and my friends. ""ahh RIP."" followed by 2 quick kissy noises.

I had to donate during the Mario block because a Super Mario Bros. 3 TAS was what introduced me to speed running some 10 years ago.
On a sadder note, cancer has affected me pretty hard these past few years. My wife's grandfather has it, my Aunt *had* it, my namesake *had* it, and two family friends *had* it. Even knowing that, I haven't lost anyone to this disease and I hope we can end it before any more lose the battle. Hopefully my contribution will move us a little closer to cancer being a small inconvenience, like the sniffles, rather than a most serious illness
I would like my $50 to go towards the runner's choice of any extra game incentive that will make the marathon longer. MOAR GAMES!

First time donating, and unfotunately not much for that, but i figured every little bit helps. Been following the AGDQ's for 4 years now and really looking forward to the Banjo Run, and Ocarina of Time, which I occasionally practice to run now myself from time to time thanks to you Guys. Nothin but respect for the Runners, good luck and keep it up!"
"21035","Hey everyone, Red from World 9 Gaming here. Could not make it to AGDQ this year but looking forward to SGDQ.

This donation means a lot due to my family's history with cancer. I lost my grandfather to pancreatic cancer and my sister-in-law at a young age to breast cancer. Here is hoping to some day soon being able to destroy cancer the way these runners are destroying these games.

Lastly, I have seen the animals saved twice in a row now, I think it is high time for some crispy animals. Kill them and game on!"
"21036","My wife and I were planning to make it to this AGDQ 9 months ago and then we had to move. Luckily, we moved 15 minutes away from the venue this year. Took this week off of work just to be here and have no regrets. My sleep schedule does on the other hand. I'm torn between save or kill the animals so why not both?"
"21037","Well guys I meant to make this donation before the race but with the tech setup for Batman I totally forgot.

I decided ahead of time that this would go towards winner's choice (or if I won, split it between the other three guys), so let's do that.

Thanks for the amazing race, and I still say Skavenger is nuts for going for the frame perfect softlock strat in a marathon."

"21964","I wasn't going to donate this year because I have little money but this game was the first game I had on my the first PC I owned, an Amstrad. I loved it and it kicked my butt, but it was a big deal at the time because my parents were farmers with little money and they spent a lot for the computer. Yep I'm getting old, but I feel the same about this game as I do about my grandmother who died from cancer last year; that I'll inevitably see them again someday. Cancer can take loved ones but it'll never take our memories, and definitely can't take our awesome games away from us. So for two things that I loved dearly, Prince of Persia and my gran, this money is for you and AGDQ."

So do we kill the animals to kill the cancer, or save the animals and then maybe kill it later if possible? An ethical quandry I leave for the runner to decide on."

I'm so glad to see it completed so quickly and in a more interesting manner.

Also it's amazing how well this game holds up visually after over a decade. Noir and friends seem like really cool cats. I'd love to know what you guys think about Half Life 2 Episode 1 and 2, and if the thought of a brand new Source Engine excites your inner nerdiness. Thanks, and take care :)"

Seriously, you two bring so much light into the lives of everyone who knows you, and I'm really happy to be able to call you guys my best friends. Given how much of yourselves you guys invest into beating cancer, and then how you invest the rest in video games, I feel that this donation is pretty much a slam dunk.

I love you guys very much.

Also, given how nonchalantly Danielle murders my dogs on Minecraft (RIP Bubblegum, Destroyer of Worlds), I'm going to say a ""Kill the animals"" is a slam dunk too. Save the frames."

Great to see Metroid Fusion being Played. By far my Favorite Metroid game of all-time. Wishing the Best of Luck to KirbyMastah, HerculesBenchpress, and JRP in their run. As for me, I've got to keep practicing the Double-Missile trick, as I still suck at pulling it off.

Also want to shoutout to Miles, DragonDarch, and AngelisX. Without you guys, I would not have started speedrunning in General. I am still working on any% and 100% Metroid Fusion and Zero Mission.

Although this donation is not much, I want to put my $5 Donation to Saving the Animals in Super Metroid. Because, Like Kirbymastah, I want to keep my favorite Metroid game, Metroid Fusion, Canon.

Lastly, I want to wish the rest of the runners good luck on their runs as well. Putting together a Speedrunning marathon like this is very incredible. Let's show Twitch that League of Legends, Dota, and anything MLG-related is Ridiculously Overrated, and that as Gamers, it is better to use our gaming talents to help others, Like Prevent Cancer Foundation, rather than ourselves.

"25475","Cottage cheese is a fresh cheese curd product with a mild flavor. It is drained, but not pressed, so some whey remains and the individual curds remain loose. The curd is usually washed to remove acidity, giving sweet curd cheese. It is not aged or colored. Different styles of cottage cheese are made from milks with different fat levels and in small-curd or large-curd preparations. Cottage cheese which is pressed becomes hoop cheese, farmer cheese, pot cheese, or queso blanco.

Cottage cheese can be eaten in a variety of different ways: by itself, with fruit and sugar, with salt and pepper, with fruit puree, on toast, with tomatoes, with granola and cinnamon, as a chip dip, as a replacement for mayonnaise in tuna or chicken salad, in salads, or used as an ingredient in recipes such as jello salad and various desserts. Cottage cheese with fruit such as pears, peaches, or mandarin oranges is a standard side dish in many ""home cooking"" or meat-and-three restaurants' menus in the United States.

"26368","Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?

Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip To Be Square"". A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself."

You're going to go far in life, and I want you to be proud of that."" He died a week later, and those were the last words he said to me. Cancer sucks, so here's some money to help make sure that no one should hear something like that sooner than they need to.

He's 90 years old now and all the money in my paychecks can't match how happy I am to still have him around and in my life.

I like watching these because they're fun, but this one for me is a pretty somber one because on this day 10 years ago my grandmother died from intestinal cancer. My love for her is greater than I can possibly put into words and not a day goes by where I don't miss her. In Honor of Catherine ""Tudy"" Bankert, here is $50 to go to runner's choice, on the condition it doesn't go to anything related to Saving or Killing anything.
